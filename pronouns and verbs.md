If you have a pronoun and a verb, you have a simple sentence, so let us start here in our journey to learn real Limit words.
There is no gender or verb conjugation for each pronoun in Limit, so this should be simple. 
Pronouns:
I = "lI"
You = "dI"
He/She/It = "krI"
We = "lId"
You (plural) = "dId
They = "krId"
If you want to make any of these pronouns formal, just add the prefix "su".
Verbs:
Present tense: Suffix "Ul" 
Past tense: Suffix "Uz"
Future tense: Suffix "Uk"
To make something perfect tense, add the prefix "ges". 
To make something progressive tense, add the prefix "kα" (if it's also perfect then put it before the perfect prefix).
To make something infinitive, remove the Uz/Ul/Uk and add the suffix "pO".
Example:
To eat is "brikpO". "I had been eating" would be "lI kαgesbrikUz".
