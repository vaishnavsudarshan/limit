Here are some rules for sentence structure:
The order of a declarative sentence is subject object verb.
Adjectives always come after nouns, attatched by a slash, without spaces. 
Articles come after nouns as well, also attatched by a slash without spaces.
If there is an article and an adjective, the adjective comes after the article, and the adjective and the article are combined with slashes as well.
There is no distinction between proper and common nouns.
Prepositions work the same way as in English.
Objects, like in English, do not have to just be nouns but also any verbs phrase that acts as a noun.
Indirect objects come right before direct objects.
Indirect objects have a suffix "hU".
Examples:
Write "I like to eat" in Limit syntax and spelling.
I tU Et lIk
Write "I give you a green box" in Limit syntax and spelling.
I yUhU boks/A/grEn giv
