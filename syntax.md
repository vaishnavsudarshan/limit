Here are some rules for sentence structure:
The order of a sentence is subject object verb.
Adjectives always come after nouns, attatched by a slash, without spaces. 
There is no distinction between proper and common nouns.
Articles come after nouns as well.
Prepositions work the same way as in English.
Objects, like in English, do not have to just be nouns but also any verbs phrase that acts as a noun.
Indirect objects come right before direct objects.
Examples:
Write "I like to eat" in Limit syntax and spelling.
I tU Et lIk
Write "I give you a box" in Limit syntax and spelling.
I yU boks A giv
