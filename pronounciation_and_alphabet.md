Limit is written in Roman characters, but there are some rules to how the script works.
Consonants are always lowercase. Each consonant is a short sound. Short vowel sounds are lowercase, while long vowel sounds are uppercase. The language is very phoenetic; the pronounciation is exactly what is written. There are no silent letters.
Examples for how to write and pronounce vowels: 
1. A short "O" like in the word "dog" would be lowercase.
2. A long "A" like in the word "cake" would be uppercase.
A quick note: The letter "U" (capital, which means long) does not contain a "y" sound in its pronounciation. It sounds like the o's in the word "food" rather than the u in the word "university".
There are some vowel and consonant sounds, of course, that cannot be produced with just the Roman alphabet. Therefore, Limit alphabet contains some extra characters as well.
Extra vowel sounds:
   "%" sounds like the two o's in the word "book".
   "@" sounds like "ow" like in the word "now".
   "α" sounds like "ah" like in the word "drama" 
Extra consonant sounds:
  "β" sounds like "zh", like in the s in "measure".
  "," sounds like "th", like in the word "think".
  "#" sounds like the n in "song".
  "!" sounds like "ch", like in the word "chair".
  "." sounds like "sh", like in the word "shook".
Also, there are some adjustments in the alphabet.
The letter "c" is removed as its sound can be made from either "k" or "s".
The letter "g" only can sound like the g in "gray", and NOT sound like a j, like in "giraffe".
The letter "j" now uses all of those "j" sounds.
The letter "q" is removed as any "qu" sound can be made with "kw" instead. "u", however, is still perfectly safe as it is important for various vowel sounds.
The letter "x" is removed as any sound with an "x" can be made from either "ks" or "z".
One last thing: Limit is pronounced in an American accent, except with the new pronounciation rules now given.
